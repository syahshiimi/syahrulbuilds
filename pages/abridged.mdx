The website was built with a PHP backend with a jQuery frontend. Sitefinity CMS, however, built a drag-n-drop component system, similar to Wix, in creating a no-code option for most of the userbase which had no coding experience.

Therefore, much of work for the website focused around component selection, design and layouting, database management and project management.
